# Final-Project
My final project is a solo player pong game. The goal for this game is to prevent the ball reach the bottom, also try to bounce it back to hit bricks in order to get points and win.

# Summary
I draw 12 bricks on the top of the screen, a ball randomly bouncing within the canvas and a brick at the bottom og the canvas that player can control. Player need to use the bottom bricks to prevent ball hitting the bottom part of the canvas, otherwise the game will end. Player also need to control the bottom bricks to bounce the ball up to hit the upper bricks in order to get points. The upper bricks will disappear when ball hit on them. Once all the upper bricks disappear the player will win.


# Component Parts
This project contain a bouncing ball, a contral brick at the bottom, 12 bricks in the upper part of the canvas for points, a score recorder on the top right corner.



# Timeline

# Challenges
I have encounter trouble when I try to make the upper bricks disappear after hit by the ball. Finally I realize i only need to change their x or y coordinate to change their location instead of actually delete them.
